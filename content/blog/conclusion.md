## My final evaluation
As I said in the beginning, I want a solution which you could be played while sitting and with your hands only. Because I had good reference material and an already finished implementation as an example for the locomotion. I wanted a polished experience when moving with the arms. These techniques should also enable embodied interaction in confined spaces so I should measure the “embodiment” and presence while playing. And in the locomotion vault this form of movement should have high “embodiment” so I hope it stays that way in the end. This will be measured using a self-designed [questionnaire]( https://forms.gle/UBuiLYi5swuAvqHX7). Also, I wanted to focus on optimizing precision because it can be difficult to control the virtual arms while enlarged or extended. At the same time, I want to reduce/prevent neausia while playing the game as much as possible. And I won’t be focusing on speed or performance because this is intended for a fun experience and leisure gameplay. 

To ask my players a couple of question I made a google questionnaire and sent it to my testers. This contains some questions about the fun while playing, how motionsick the players felt (if at all), how stressful the game was and some additional notes. 

So for the fun while playing I had an average score of 8.5, so I would say that the players had fun while playing the game. From one player it was remarked that: „Mit mehr content bietet der physical controller bestimmt immer wieder spiel Spaß“ this is okay for a demo like that but it shows that there is potential in it for more. 1 is not much fun and 10 is very much fun.

Next up was the question about motion sickness. Here as I already told I have from one player a strait 1, but this is because of the predisposition of the player. But for the rest (including me) we had no problems with motion sickness. 1 was very motion sick and 10 was not at all.

With further development it could be tested if vignettes could help with the motion sickness. 

While developing and testing I found out that playing for a while causes some fatigue in the arms of oneself. So I asked my testers to state if they were fatigued while playing. But because of the low playtime of my players this wasn’t really an issue. 1 was no fatigue and 5 was very fatigued.

And for the playtime of 5 to 10 minutes my players collected many coins except for one player which focused for on the trying out and getting through the course rather than collecting many coins.

## Conclusion
It was a fun experience to work on my first VR project. Because of some time constraints and a lack of experience in VR development I couldn’t accomplish everything that I wanted. But I think I made a nice little mini demo which could be played while sitting and makes fun. The problems with motion sickness weren’t really a problem except for players which had already some problems with that.  Which is shown by the Motionsicknes 1 that was given. 

With the many small or big problems I encountered I found out that many Problems look very difficult at the beginning, especially if you are stuck on the starting idea. But if you change the initial idea, you can find a better idea most of the time.
