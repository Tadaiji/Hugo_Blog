## The core idea
The core idea of the project was to let the player play the game in tight spaces and without much effort. To achieve that I wanted the player to expand his arm length with a slider or an system which controls the arm’s length proportionately.  
I think VR can be a mainstream technology in the future and we won’t use controllers anymore. So, I wanted to implement the locomotion and interaction methods, so they don’t rely on controllers. At the same time, I play VR most of the time while sitting so I needed implementations which don’t need too much space and can be played while sitting.
