### What is todo for this week
For the first week we should work on your first VR project and implement Roll a Ball in Unity if we can. Roll a Ball is the first VR Project for a starting VR developer they said. So this is what I did for this week. But starting our first project comes with the installation of Unity and deploying the project to the Quest.

###  How to install Unity
How to install and setup Unity:
Setting up Unity is an easy feat in today\’s time, because of the Unity-Hub. The Unity-Hub is a office Unity Software and allows you to install almost any Unity-Build with the necessary options to install all relevant development and deployment methods for the selected Unity-Build. 
So I went to the [Unity Website](https://unity.com/).

From there I clicked on the “Get started” button and could sign up for the student or personal license. And if you are signed up or just logged in than you can download the Unity-Hub over [your profile](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/update).

And after following the setup I got Unity-Hub, which looks something like this.

From here we need to install a Unity-Build. Now for the upcoming project I need an Android-build and a Windows build.

Now with a Unity-Build installed I can create a project with it. To my surprise the interface changed so I will include a side by side picture from when I last saw it to now.

And also I found out that Unity has a VR template, which I downloaded for a quick and easy start.

###  Unboxing the Quest 2
So, this isn’t my first time unboxing a Quest 2 because coincidentally I rented a Quest 2 a Month before because I wanted to play the just released Bonelabs(https://www.stresslevelzero.com/). The game is pretty nice, but I personally liked the previous game Boneworks more. I could also start a how another blog about Stress Level Zero, BrandonJLa and Corridor Digital and how much I like and follow them, but this is for another time. So, for the time being I have 2 Quests and I want to try local Multiplayer games.
