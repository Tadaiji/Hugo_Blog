This Blog starts as a project for the "Interaction in Virtual and Augmented Reality" course of the [TU-Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/). 

For this course we have the task to make a blog about a interactive and locomotion driven virtual reality application/game. So my project blog is sectioned into weeks and they are also linked in the Week overview down below.
