My first project is based on Gorilla Tag. It was developed for the "Interaction in Virtual and Augmented Reality" course at the [TU-Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/). It uses the same physics as gorilla tag, in the form of hands, to propell the player to move around a course and collect coins. There are also some interactions to clear.
