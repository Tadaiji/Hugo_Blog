      <description>Gorilla Tag My first project is based on Gorilla Tag. It was developed for the &amp;ldquo;Interaction in Virtual and Augmented Reality&amp;rdquo; course at the TU-Darmstadt. It uses the same physics as gorilla tag, in the form of hands, to propell the player to move around a course and collect coins. There are also some interactions to clear.
